Welcome

If you are reading this, you are officially making progress 👏

This repository is a safe practice space to help you get comfortable with Git and the pull request workflow.

Your Mission

Install Git on your computer if you have not already

Connect Git to your GitHub account

Clone this practice repository to your local machine

At this point, you should have a local copy of this repo on your computer.

Create a new branch named Practice Branch.

This branch is your personal workspace. All of your changes should happen here, not on the main branch.

Find the text file named Change Me!
Add a few words or a short sentence to the file. The content does not matter. This is just to practice making a change.

Save the file once you are done.

Commit your change using Git.

Be sure to include a short commit message that explains what you changed. This message does not need to be long, just clear.

Push your branch to GitHub.

This step publishes your branch so it is visible on GitHub as your version of the project.

After you push your branch, go to this repository on GitHub in your web browser. GitHub will usually show a banner suggesting that you create a pull request for your recently pushed branch.

This allows me to review your changes and merge them into the project.
